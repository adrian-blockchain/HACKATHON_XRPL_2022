## Inspiration


The Trashtag Challenge is a popular environmental initiative that encourages people to clean up their local communities and remove litter and waste from the environment. This challenge has gained widespread attention and support, with many people taking part in the challenge and making a positive impact on their local environments.

## What it does

Our application is a revolutionary way to incentivize waste collection and help the environment. By using a cryptocurrency, we are able to reward individuals and organizations for collecting and properly disposing of waste.

Our NFT marketplace offers a unique and innovative way for FMCG companies to achieve their CSR commitments. By tokenizing waste, we are able to create digital assets that represent real-world waste collection and disposal efforts.

Through our marketplace, FMCG companies can purchase waste tokens to offset their environmental impact and demonstrate their commitment to sustainability. Each waste token represents a certain amount of waste that has been collected and properly disposed of, providing a transparent and verifiable way for companies to offset their carbon footprint.

## How we built it

Our technology has been built on two different platforms: a mobile application developed using the Flutter framework, and an NFT marketplace built using the Next.js framework.

## Challenges we ran into

One common challenge is the approval process for app submissions. Both the Apple App Store and Google Play Store have strict guidelines for app content and functionality. For the moment we cannot implement blockchain in our application because we do not have yet the correct legal status.

Another challenge is ensuring compatibility and interoperability between these different technologies. For example, the mobile app and web application need to be able to communicate with the backend and blockchain infrastructure in order to function properly. This requires careful planning and coordination to ensure that all components are compatible and able to work together seamlessly.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud to have developed an application. Today, we are focus on the blockchain part to be able to create a real web 3 economy for waste management.

## What we learned

Thanks to this hackathon, we learned how to work as a team, to manage a project and finally we discovered how to use XRPL network.

## What's next for Trashtag

Release our application on apple and google store, communicate on it. Then find FMCG companies which would be interested in our solution. And finally, create a real economical incentive to collect waste everywhere in the world.
